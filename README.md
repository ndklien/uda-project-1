## Dataset

> The data including information of 183.412 ford gobike trips in San Francisco area with 16 variables (duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip). But some datas stayed in the mismatched format so it needs to be cleaned.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there are relationships between age, gender, day of week, and hour to the duration of trips. The number of riders is located more in San Francisco and less in Oakland and Berkeley. The reason why people concentrated in San Francisco because is it's a travelling city so it have a lot of travelers visited and they rent the bike to go around the city and the beach easier. Besides that, People would prefer riding a bike on weekends rather than weekdays. The root cause for this might be most of them busy with their work on weekday and they only want to ride on their day-off.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In this presentation, I just only focus on the location, duration, gender, and age. I started by showing the start location and pick top 10 start location has most riders and recommend them to focus more on these locations. Next one I show the distribution of users by gender (Male, Female and Other), it shows that the majority of users are men. Then I plot the distributed of trip duration by second and gender to deep dive in the problem.
